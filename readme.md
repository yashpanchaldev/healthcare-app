HealthCare API Backend
üåü Project Overview
This repository hosts the robust backend API for a comprehensive digital HealthCare platform. Built upon the powerful Node.js runtime and the minimalist Express.js framework, this application provides a centralized system for managing key healthcare operations, including secure user authentication, precise doctor appointment scheduling, complete medicine/pharmacy inventory management, dissemination of vital health article content, user cart functionality for prescriptions, and a robust reviews system. The architecture is designed to efficiently support both Patient (User) and Administrative roles.
The application adheres to a highly modular and clean architectural style, employing a robust MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern augmented with dedicated Service and Repository layers (implied within the service/ directory). This separation ensures high maintainability, testability, and scalability for future feature development.
üí° Architectural Philosophy
Scalability and Performance
The choice of Node.js leverages its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making the API highly efficient at handling numerous concurrent connections, which is critical for a high-traffic application like a healthcare platform. Express is used to provide the necessary routing and middleware structure without imposing unnecessary overhead.
Security and Reliability
Security is a primary concern. User authentication is managed using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and sensitive data like passwords are never stored in plain text, utilizing industry-standard hashing algorithms. Furthermore, the authMiddleware ensures strict access control, verifying user identity and roles before granting access to protected resources (like /admin or /user routes).
‚ú® Key Features
User & Authentication
Secure Authentication: Implements standard user signup and login processes, complimented by seamless Google OAuth integration for quick access.
Password Management: Complete system for handling forgotten passwords, including token-based reset functionality delivered securely via email.
User Profiles: Dedicated endpoints to retrieve and update detailed patient profile information, ensuring data accuracy.
Authorization: Mandatory route protection using custom Express middleware to enforce role-based access for authenticated users and system administrators.
Doctor & Appointment Management
Doctor CRUD (Admin): Comprehensive administrative controls to add new doctors, manage their credentials and specializations, and soft-delete doctor profiles when necessary.
Doctor Scheduling (Admin): Tools for administrators or doctors themselves to define and manage doctor availability slots, optimizing patient flow and capacity.
Patient Actions: Patients can browse a complete list of available doctors, view detailed profiles (including reviews), and book, reschedule, or cancel appointments through dedicated transactional endpoints.
Review System: A dedicated module allows users to submit, edit, or delete reviews and ratings for doctors, providing valuable feedback and social proof.
Pharmacy & E-commerce
Medicine Category CRUD (Admin): Full administrative control over organizing medicines into categories (e.g., Pain Relief, Vitamins).
Medicine CRUD (Admin): Full lifecycle management for individual medicine products, including pricing, stock, description, and handling associated media (images, instructional videos) via specific media update/delete endpoints.
Cart Management (User): Enables patients to add prescribed or required medicines to a shopping cart, view the cart summary, adjust quantities, and remove items before checkout.
Health Content (Articles)
Article Management: Tools for content creators to draft, publish, update, and manage health articles.
Media Support: Robust handling for various media types (text, images, video) associated with each article, stored and managed externally via Cloudinary.
Content Organization: Dedicated CRUD operations for managing article categories (e.g., Nutrition, Mental Health).
User Engagement: Functionality for users to quickly save or unsave articles, with a dedicated route to retrieve a user's curated collection of saved content.

git clone <repository_url>
cd healthcare-api-backend



Install dependencies:
npm install
# or
yarn install

Role of Key Directories
controller/: These files handle incoming requests from the routes. Their main job is to validate input, delegate tasks to the service layer, and format the final HTTP response (including handling status codes and sending JSON data). They act as the public interface to the application logic.
service/: This is the heart of the business logic. Service files encapsulate complex operations like database transactions, external API calls (Cloudinary, Mangopay), and complex data manipulations. By abstracting this logic, controllers remain lean, and the application becomes easier to test and maintain.
middleware/: Contains functions that process incoming requests before they hit the controller. The most important here is authMiddleware, which ensures that only users with a valid token and the correct permissions can access protected endpoints.
