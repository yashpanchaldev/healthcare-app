# HealthCare API Backend

## üåü Project Overview
This repository hosts the robust backend API for a comprehensive digital HealthCare platform. Built on **Node.js** with the **Express.js** framework, this API provides a centralized system for managing key healthcare operations including:

- Secure user authentication
- Doctor appointment scheduling
- Medicine and pharmacy inventory management
- Health article content management
- User cart functionality for prescriptions
- Doctor and service reviews system

The application supports both **Patient (User)** and **Administrative** roles, following a modular architecture with a **MVC pattern**, along with dedicated Service and Repository layers for maintainability and scalability.

## üí° Architectural Philosophy

### Scalability & Performance
- Node.js provides a non-blocking, event-driven architecture suitable for high concurrency.
- Express.js handles routing and middleware efficiently without unnecessary overhead.

### Security & Reliability
- **Authentication**: Managed via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Data Security**: Passwords are securely hashed; authMiddleware enforces role-based access.
- **Access Control**: Protected routes ensure only authorized users can access sensitive operations.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### User & Authentication
- **Secure Sign-Up/Login** with JWT.
- **Google OAuth** integration.
- **Password Management** with token-based reset emails.
- **User Profiles**: Retrieve and update patient info.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access enforced via middleware.

### Doctor & Appointment Management
- **Doctor CRUD** (Admin only).
- **Doctor Scheduling** and slot management.
- **Patient Actions**: View doctors, book/reschedule/cancel appointments.
- **Review System**: Users can submit, update, or delete reviews.

### Pharmacy & E-Commerce
- **Medicine Category CRUD** (Admin).
- **Medicine CRUD** with media management (images/videos).
- **Cart Management** for users to manage prescriptions.

### Health Content (Articles)
- **Article CRUD**: Create, update, manage health articles.
- **Media Support**: Text, images, and videos stored in Cloudinary.
- **Article Categories** for organized content.
- **Saved Articles**: Users can save or unsave articles for quick access.
